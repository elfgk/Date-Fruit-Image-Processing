# Date Fruit Image Processing

This project focuses on the processing and analysis of date fruit images. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can classify and analyze images of date fruits, identifying features such as quality, ripeness, and defects.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Images of date fruits were collected for training and testing the model.

2. **Image Preprocessing:**
   - Preprocessing techniques were applied to prepare the images for analysis. This includes resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

3. **Model Development:**
   - A machine learning model (Convolutional Neural Network - CNN) was trained to classify the images into different categories (e.g., ripe, unripe, defective).

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5. **Deployment (Optional):**
   - The model can be deployed for real-time predictions or used in various applications related to quality control in the agricultural industry.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of date fruits. The images are labeled into different categories based on the ripeness and quality of the fruit.

- `ripe`: Images of fully ripe date fruits.
- `unripe`: Images of unripe date fruits.
- `defective`: Images of defective or damaged date fruits.

## Libraries Used

- `tensorflow` and `keras`: For building and training the deep learning model.
- `opencv` and `PIL`: For image processing.
- `numpy` and `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:
